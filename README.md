This is a group project!
We are going through the process a software engineering company would start, create, and finish a project. 
We will place all of our meeting notes of what was discussed and accomplished during the time. 
We will also place Software Architecture and Software requirements documents of how our project will be made as well as all UML case diagrams and class diagrams
